  <p>Microplastics can leech into the flesh of marine animals. This can travel up the food chain and eventually create harm for humans. Microplastics aren't the only issue, however. Chemicals such as mercury and cadmium can come into contact with marine life through industrial plants.</p>

    <h1>Impacts on <strong>Marine Life</strong></h1>
  </div>
  <p>Oceans are the home of many different types of organisms. From microbacteria to sharks, all life is negatively affected by marine pollution. For example, algae blooms can decrease the amount of available oxygen for some organisms, slowly suffocating them. Plastics can also become tangled in the fins and necks of others.</p>

    <h1>Impacts on the <strong>Environment</strong></h1>
  </div>
  <p>In the process, the oceans are being damaged. As more pollutants enter the waters, more people, more organisms are being harmed. This is a global issue in which awareness needs to be raised.</p>
